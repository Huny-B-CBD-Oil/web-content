# Huny'B's Philosophy

We are a company founded on the basis of friendship and hope. The friendship we have with each other. The hope we have is for everyone. We felt a need in our lives to be a positive influence on the environment, our society, and those in need.

We work to carry out these core principles by using recyclable materials, sourcing such materials for our use when and where we can. We are developing work areas for children with Autism simply because it has hit those we love. We believe in saving the bees. We include the lab report to ensure that we are not using products treated with pesticides. As we grow, our efforts will grow.

But first we have to provide a product worth buying. No product is worth selling if you don’t use it yourself. We and quite a few of our friends enjoy the benefits of our products. There are different lines for different purposes. Designed with an eye towards providing whatever benefits exist in the top quality ingredients we use.

We have lotions, body butters, lotion bars, bath bombs, bath salts and shower steamers to soothe and relax. We also have liniments and salves for sore muscles. ALL of our products contain CBD.. Read the descriptions carefully, Educate yourself as to the benefits of each ingredient. For ease of use we have provide links to third party sites. We have scanned these for any problems, but remember to always think and use security when browsing the net. 

Our ordering process is designed especially to protect your identifying information and billing information. Nuff said on that. We don’t share our secrets. Those of our products or the security we use.
